Weekly MTB Schedule (2 sessions/week Whenever I am able to)
MTB Ride 1 (Endurance Ride – Zone 2)
1.5–2 hours at a comfortable pace (~9–11 mph avg)
Keep heart rate conversational
Focus on smooth cadence (~80–90 rpm)
Goal: aerobic base + fat adaptation
MTB Ride 2 (Power & Skills Ride)
Warm-up: 10 min easy spin
Main set:
6 × 3 min hard climbs or fast segments (Zone 4), 3 min easy in between
Work on standing climbs, cornering, and handling
Cool-down: 10 min spin
Monthly Progression
September: 2 rides/week → 15–20 miles each
October: Build to 25–30 mile long ride (3 hours) once per week
November: Add back-to-back days (e.g., Sat long MTB ride + Sun run) for endurance toughness
December: Taper down MTB volume before your birthday run, keep easy spins for recovery
