Phase 1: Recovery & Reset (2 weeks after Dec 4)
Goal: Let legs/joints/tendons recover while staying active.
Running:
Week 1: 3 short runs (20–30 min easy jog). No pace target, just movement.
Week 2: 4 runs (25–40 min easy, 1 optional strides session: 6×15s fast strides w/ 90s walk).
Cross-training: Bike, walk, mobility.
Lifting: Keep your normal push/pull/legs/upper split, lighter weight on legs.
🗓️ Phase 2: Base Building (Jan–Feb, ~8 weeks)
Weekly structure (run every day):
Mon – Easy Run (30–45 min @ easy pace)
Tue – Intervals (e.g. 8×400m @ 5k effort w/ 90s jog)
Wed – Easy Run (30 min + strides)
Thu – Tempo Run (20–25 min continuous @ comfortably hard)
Fri – Easy Run (30–40 min)
Sat – Long Run (start at 6 miles, add 0.5–1 mile per week → cap ~12 miles)
Sun – Recovery Run (25–35 min slow)
👉 Purpose: rebuild aerobic base, improve lactate threshold, gradually extend long runs.
🗓️ Phase 3: Strength + Speed (Mar–Apr, ~8 weeks)
Weekly structure:
Mon – Easy Run
Tue – Hill Repeats (8×200m hill sprints, jog down recoveries)
Wed – Easy Run
Thu – Tempo Run (30–35 min, progress to 2×20 min intervals)
Fri – Easy Run
Sat – Long Run (10–14 miles w/ last 2 miles faster)
Sun – Recovery Run
👉 Purpose: build strength (hills) + endurance speed.
🗓️ Phase 4: Continuous Progression (Indefinite Cycle)
Repeat the following 3-phase cycle indefinitely so you’re always improving without burning out:
Base (8–12 weeks) → build mileage & aerobic capacity.
Strength/Speed (8–12 weeks) → hills, intervals, tempos.
Race Specific (8–12 weeks) → choose a goal (5k, 10k, half-marathon, or even another marathon) and tailor workouts.
Each year, your long run can gradually extend (14 → 16 → 18), your intervals can sharpen (from 400s → 800s → mile repeats), and your tempos can lengthen.
🔁 Indefinite Progression Rules
Every 4th week → cut mileage by ~30% (deload).
Long run → progress slowly (10% rule).
Easy pace → always conversational.
Add new stimuli in cycles (hills, tempos, intervals).
Strength training + mobility → keeps you injury-free so progress can actually be indefinite.
